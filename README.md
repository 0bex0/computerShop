# Computer Shop 
System written in Java to allow company to display items they are selling.

User 101 is allowed admin access which allows them to add products to the shop. All other users can filter product displayed to them, add a desired amount of a selected product to their basket and save or cancel their basket (which saves a suitable record in LogFile.txt). The user can then checkout, choosing to pay by PayPal or credit card. There's also an option for any user to log out of the system, returning to the login page.
